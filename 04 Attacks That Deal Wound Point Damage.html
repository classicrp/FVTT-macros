<p><span style="font-family: Arial">Some attacks can be used to deal wound points damage directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Critical Hits:</strong> <em style="color:darkred">Only the dice are rolled for Critical Hits, all other bonuses only count with the initial roll. For example, if your weapon has a x3 or higher multiplier, then the roll would be multiple dice (i.e. a Greataxe has a x3 critical multiplier, so the initial damage roll would be 1d12 plus all bonuses, the extra damage from the critical would be 2d12 only).</em> When a creature is subject to a critical hit, the critical hit deals the damage normally, reducing vigor points first, and then reducing wound points when vigor points are gone. It also <strong>directly</strong> deals an amount of wound point damage equal to its critical multiplier (for example, 3 wound points for a weapon with a ×3 modifier), on top of any wound point damage the creature might take from the critical hit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Negative Energy Damage:</strong> When a creature deals negative energy damage to a creature with a spell or effect, <s style="background:lightsteelblue">it can choose to deal wound point or vigor point damage (but not both) with the spell or effect.
