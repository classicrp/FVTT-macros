<p><span style="font-family: Arial">A creature can regain wound and vigor points in a number of ways, but in general it is easier to regain vigor points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Healing Spells and Effects:</strong> When casting healing spells or using an ability with a healing effect (such as channeling holy energy on living creatures or the paladin’s lay on hands ability), the creature casting the spell or using the effect <s style="background:lightsteelblue">must choose whether it wants to heal wound points or vigor points. The creature decides this before casting the spell or using the ability.

<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><em style="color:darkred"><strong>Heal vigor points;</strong></em> the healing spell or effect acts normally, replenishing a number of vigor points equal to the number of hit points the spell or effect would normally heal. <s style="background:lightsteelblue">If the creature decides to</s></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif"><em style="color:darkred"><strong>Heal wound points;</strong></em> it heals a number of wound points equal to the number of dice it would normally roll for the healing spell or effect. In the case of effects like the heal spell, where a spell or effect heals 10 hit points per caster level, the creature heals its caster level in wound points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial">For instance, if a 12th-level cleric uses her channel positive energy power to replenish wound points to living creatures, she would typically heal (6d6) 6 wound points for all living creatures with her channel energy burst. If she casts the heal spell (120), she would restore 12 wound points to the creature touched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Rest:</strong> When a creature has a full night’s rest (8 hours of sleep or more), that creature regains all its vigor points and 1 wound point. If there is a significant interruption during a rest, the creature regains neither wound points nor vigor points. If a creature undergoes complete bed rest for an entire day, it regains <s style="background:lightsteelblue">half its level in</s> <em style="color:darkred">2 wound points plus an additional amount equal to its Constitution modifier</em> and all its vigor points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><strong>Restoration and Similar Effects:</strong> When a creature regains Constitution points by way of the restoration spell or a similar effect, that creature regains 2 wound points for every Constitution point regained. Relieving a Constitution penalty or Constitution drain regains any wound points that were lost from that penalty or drain.</span></p>
